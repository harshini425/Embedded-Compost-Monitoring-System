# Embedded Compost Monitoring System

## Overview
An embedded system designed to monitor key composting parameters such as moisture and temperature in a simulated environment.  
The system helps maintain optimal conditions for efficient organic waste decomposition.  

## Objective
To design a low-cost embedded monitoring system that observes composting conditions such as moisture and temperature, helping maintain an efficient and controlled composting process.

## Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- TinkerCAD Simulator  
- Embedded C / Arduino framework  
- Environmental sensors (simulated)

## Project Status
Simulation completed using TinkerCAD. Hardware implementation with real compost sensors is planned for future work.

## Future Scope
- Integration of real-time temperature and gas sensors  
- IoT-based remote monitoring dashboard  
- Power optimization for long-term deployment  
- Data logging for compost quality analysis
